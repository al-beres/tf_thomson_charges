First week was dedicated to learning about the problem and getting our first script running.

We created our first script derivated from a public project that runs Adam optimizer over TensorFlow. This framework has the advantage of facilitating the use of GPU
	- Set up a collaborative environment on GitHub
	- Install packages and convert old scripts to newer Python 3 and TensorFlow 2
	- Fix bugs and run code
	- Learn about the script
	
The program is able to generate N points at optimal positions in the 3 dimension sphere (S3). The objective function is the square of the XXXX. There is no treatment of local minima (CHECK).

Next steps
	- flexibilize the objective functions to 1/|x-y|^alpha. In particular the project intended objective is alpha = 1
	- flexibilize the number of dimensions
	- study possible contributions such as
		- the treatment of local minima
		- comparison of other optimizers against Adam
